## DVD Rental Project

### Date created
June 21st, 2020

### Required Software and Packages
Postgres SQL --version 13

### Description
In this project, I used a large database from a DVD rental company with two stores to analyze some statistics about their rentals. This project was actually my final project to pass the SQL section of my Udacity data science Nanodegree program. As you can see, the SQL queries used in this project are much more complicated than the previous project since I had to answer very specific questions about this dataset.

The first question I answered was: what family category sub-category leads each rental duration quartile? The second question was: how does the family category compare vs all other categories combined? The third question was: what are the month-by-month spending changes for the top ten movie renters? And finally the last question: who are the most popular actors based on movie rentals?
